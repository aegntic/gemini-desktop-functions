# Gemini Linux Function Manager

**Project Goal:** To create a native Linux desktop application that provides a chat interface for Google Gemini, while also allowing users to define, manage, and potentially execute custom Gemini Functions (Tools) directly within the application. This project bridges the gap between the standard Gemini web/app interfaces and the developer-focused API/Google AI Studio, delivering a power-user environment tailored for Linux.

## Unique Value Proposition
- **Native Linux Integration:** Designed specifically for Linux, ensuring seamless desktop integration.
- **Custom Function Management:** Define, enable, and manage custom functions (Tools) that Gemini can invoke during conversations, extending beyond predefined capabilities.
- **Advanced Function Editing:** A visual schema builder simplifies function creation, making it accessible to users of all skill levels.
- **Simulation and Testing Environment:** A built-in sandbox enables testing functions with mock data, ensuring reliability and confidence.
- **Enhanced Security Features:** Granular permissions and a review process for local execution offer robust control and safety.
- **Developer Tool Integration:** CLI and Git support streamline workflows for power users and developers.
- **AI-Assisted Function Creation:** Gemini's AI suggests function schemas and improvements, simplifying complex tasks.
- **Function Versioning and History:** Track changes and revert to previous versions for better productivity and organization.
- **Customizable UI:** Themes and layouts adapt to user preferences, enhancing comfort and satisfaction.
- **Analytics and Logging Dashboard:** Usage stats and performance metrics aid in optimizing functions and troubleshooting.
- **Dynamic Function Templates:** Pre-built, customizable templates accelerate onboarding and provide reusable building blocks.

## Key Features
- **Native Linux Interface:** Built with Qt or GTK for optimal performance and integration.
- **Gemini Chat Interface:** A familiar chat window for interacting with the Gemini model.
- **API Key Management:** Securely store and manage the user's Gemini API key.
- **Function/Tool Definition UI:** Create or import Gemini Function declarations (JSON schemas) using a drag-and-drop visual interface.
- **Function/Tool Management:** List, enable, disable, and edit defined functions for use in conversations.
- **Function Call Handling:** Process and respond to function calls initiated by Gemini.
- **Simulation and Testing Environment:** Test functions with mock data in a safe, isolated sandbox.
- **Enhanced Security for Local Execution:** Granular permissions and user approval for executing local scripts/commands.
- **Developer Tool Integration:** CLI support and Git integration for version control and automation.
- **AI-Assisted Function Creation:** AI-driven suggestions for function schemas and enhancements.
- **Function Versioning and History:** Save and revert to previous function versions with ease.
- **Customizable UI:** Light/dark themes and adjustable layouts for a personalized experience.
- **Analytics and Logging Dashboard:** Monitor usage, performance, and execution logs in real-time.
- **Dynamic Function Templates:** Access a library of pre-built templates for common tasks.
- **Conversation History:** Store and retrieve past conversations for continuity.

## Technology Stack
- **Language:** Python 3 – Selected for its robust Gemini API support, mature GUI bindings, and rapid development cycle.
- **GUI Toolkit:** PyQt/PySide (Qt) – Chosen for its comprehensive widget set and potential cross-platform adaptability; GTK is an alternative for Linux-specific integration.
- **Gemini API Client:** `google-generativeai` – Official library ensuring compatibility and adherence to best practices.
- **Configuration/Storage:** SQLite – A reliable, file-based database for local data management without server dependencies.
- **Packaging:** TBD (e.g., `setup.py`, Flatpak, AppImage, or system packages).
