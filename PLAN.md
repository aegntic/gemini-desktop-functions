# Gemini Linux Function Manager - Development Plan

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the development plan for the Gemini Linux Function Manager, a native Linux desktop application that integrates a Gemini chat interface with advanced custom function definition and management capabilities. Targeting power users and developers, this project extends beyond the standard Gemini web UI by offering a robust, feature-rich environment on Linux.

This project involves complex UI development, API interactions, secure credential handling, and optional local code execution, requiring careful planning and execution.

## 2. Architecture Overview
The application adopts a modular design for maintainability and scalability:
- **`core` Module:** Manages core logic, state, and coordination between UI and backend components.
- **`api_client` Module:** Handles all Gemini API communications (authentication, chat messages, tool configurations, function calls).
- **`ui` Module:** Contains all UI components (chat window, tool definition forms, settings panels) using Qt or GTK.
- **`tool_manager` Module:** Oversees the lifecycle of user-defined tools/functions (loading, saving, validating schemas, interfacing with the API client).
- **`local_executor` Module (Optional):** Securely executes local scripts/commands triggered by Gemini function calls, with sandboxing and permission controls.
- **`persistence` Module:** Manages storage of conversation history, tool definitions, and settings using SQLite.
- **`simulation_environment` Module:** Provides a sandbox for testing functions with mock data.
- **`analytics_logging` Module:** Collects and displays usage stats, performance metrics, and execution logs.

## 3. Technology Choices
- **Language: Python:** Selected for its strong Gemini API support via `google-generativeai`, mature GUI libraries, and rapid prototyping capabilities. Alternatives like C++ were considered but deemed less efficient for iteration.
- **GUI Toolkit: PyQt/PySide (Qt):** Preferred for its extensive features and potential cross-platform support; GTK is a viable Linux-specific alternative. Electron was rejected due to resource overhead.
- **API Library: `google-generativeai`:** Official library ensures compatibility and leverages Google's best practices.
- **Persistence: SQLite:** Chosen over flat files (e.g., JSON/YAML) for its robust querying and reliability in a local context.
- **Security:** API keys stored via OS keychain (e.g., `keyring`); local execution secured with sandboxing tools (e.g., `firejail`, `bubblewrap`) and explicit permissions.
- **Version Control:** Git for managing function schema versions.

## 4. Key Challenges
- **API Complexity:** Implementing and managing Tool/Function schemas and function call workflows accurately.
- **Secure API Key Storage:** Protecting the Gemini API key from unauthorized access.
- **UI State Management:** Ensuring responsive synchronization between chat and tool management interfaces.
- **Local Execution Security:** Mitigating risks of local script/command execution with a robust security model.
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully managing API errors, network issues, and schema validation failures.
- **Asynchronous Operations:** Maintaining UI responsiveness during long-running API calls.
- **AI-Assisted Function Creation:** Seamlessly integrating AI suggestions into the function creation workflow.

## 5. Development Milestones (Phased Approach)
**Phase 1: Core API Integration & Basic Chat UI** (Estimated: 2-3 weeks)

- Create a settings panel for user preferences.

**Phase 9: Analytics and Logging Dashboard** (Estimated: 2-3 weeks)
- Collect and display usage stats, performance metrics, and logs.
- Integrate with the UI for real-time monitoring.

**Phase 10: Dynamic Function Templates** (Estimated: 2-3 weeks)
- Develop a library of pre-built templates.
- Add UI for browsing and customizing templates.

**Phase 11: Refinement, Packaging & Documentation** (Estimated: 2-3 weeks)
- Polish UI/UX and add settings.
- Enhance error handling and testing.
- Package the application and provide comprehensive documentation.

## 6. Project Management
- **Version Control:** Git with a feature branch workflow; pull requests require at least one review.
- **Continuous Integration:** CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) for automated testing and linting.
- **User Feedback:** Collected via GitHub issues/discussions; beta releases for early input.
- **Milestone Reviews:** Conducted at the end of each phase to evaluate progress and adjust plans.

## 7. Scalability and Performance Considerations
- Optimize SQLite queries for conversation and tool history.
- Use asynchronous API calls to ensure UI responsiveness.
- Cache frequently accessed data (e.g., tool schemas) for efficiency.

## 8. Future Considerations
- Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS).
- Plugin system for third-party tools.
- Advanced configuration options.
- Multi-API provider support.
- System notification integration.
